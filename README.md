# README

- Virtual machine with Tinyos and Cooja (simulator) [here](http://home.deib.polimi.it/redondi/IoT/IOT-ubuntu.ova)
- run Cooja to start the simulation placed in the "simulations" folder

## Useful commands

- **make telosb**: it compiles the code. The resulting file "main.exe" can then be used in the simulator (add a Sky Mote mote and use this file)
